It is likely to have a bigger impact on poverty reduction than in other sectors as it offers the most direct route of raising returns to poor people’s main assets, i.e. land and labour. The AECF’s work in the agriculture sector is the oldest and largest of its investments with a total of US$ 183 million committed across Africa. The Fund supports businesses to establish a new activity or expand existing businesses across the value chain, as long as the primary beneficiaries of the businesses are rural households living on less than US$ 2 per day.\\xa0',\n",
       "       'Accessible Innovations for Smallholders:\\xa0The Fund invests in businesses that have the potential to reach smallholder farmers to improve agricultural productivity and increase household income and food security. We work in a wide range of value chains and production systems to increase access to better quality agricultural inputs, improved seeds varieties and livestock vaccines, introduce new farming systems and agribusiness models.\\xa0',\n",
       "       'Scaling Up Innovative Businesses:\\xa0The Fund acts as the missing link between agricultural research and smallholder farmers by financing the commercialization of new technologies where others will not.

       "       'Promoting Financial Inclusion and Mobile Finance:\\xa0Improving access to finance is a priority for AECF. The Fund supports projects that use mobile money systems, create local financing mechanisms, introduce weather based insurance and establish credit systems.

It also establishes non-collateral credit scoring for smallholders that enable them to access formal financial systems in the future.',\n",
